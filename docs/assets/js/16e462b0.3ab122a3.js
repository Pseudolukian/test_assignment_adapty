The ultimate goal is to determine which version is more effective based on the average revenue per user over a 12-month period. However, waiting for a full year to collect data and make decisions is impractical. Therefore, a 2-week revenue per user is used as a proxy metric, chosen based on historical data analysis to approximate the target metric. To achieve accurate and reliable results, it is crucial to employ a robust statistical method capable of handling diverse data types. Bayesian statistics, a popular approach in modern data analysis, provides a flexible and intuitive framework for A/B testing. By incorporating prior knowledge and updating it with new data, Bayesian methods allow for better decision-making under uncertainty.
